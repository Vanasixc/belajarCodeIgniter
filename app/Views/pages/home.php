                    community and certainly parts of the heavy metal crowd as well. It blurs the line between beauty
                    and melancholy, with plenty of guitar fireworks and riffage that’s augmented by synths instead
                    of overshadowed by them." ~Deadrhetoric.com</p>

                    On top of the five songs, the self-titled track “Ave Mujica” is also included, which is a song

                    Bang Dream! Ave Mujica itself has a deep character. Although not as <i id="italicText">banger</i> as
